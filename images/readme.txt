"With the i9IDXpress plugin, bloggers can embed **live** real estate listings (using what is known as *I*nternet *D*ata E*x*change, or IDX) into their blog's posts and pages using something WordPress calls "shortcodes" and into their sidebars using the included widgets. The plugin also functions as a full IDX solution by allowing visitors to search for, and view the details of, listings in the MLS.*Important requirements to use this plugin** You must be an active member with a multiple listing service (MLS). This means that anyone other than real estate agents and brokers (and, in some MLS's, even agents are excluded) cannot use this plugin.* The executives at the MLS must be progressive enough to allow the data to be syndicated to your blog from our ([Diverse Solutions]) API.* Downloading and installing the dsIDXpress plugin is 100% free, but getting the data from your MLS is not. You can use the [free demo data](http://www.i9techus.com/pricing.php) in the beginning and move on to obtaining data after you've evaluated it.* Your web host must be running at least PHP 5.2. PHP 5.2 has been out since 2006, so if they aren't using PHP 5.2, they're quite a ways behind the times. This is almost never an issue nowadays.* You must be using at least WordPress 2.8. It will run faster on WordPress 2.9.1 and later.i9IDXpress contains many advanced features that enable bloggers to create "sticky content," visitors to find properties they like, and search engines to crawl the data so that the listings show up with the blogger's domain in the search engines. It is intended to be a real estate agent's / broker's all-inclusive interface between the MLS they belong to and their WordPress site / blog. Following is a very high-level overview of the plugin's functionality.
